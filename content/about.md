Hi! I'm a data scientist and I love helping people make better, more informed decisions.

An important part of this mission is teaching people how to literally harness the power of the scientific method. I want to show everyone how to make good, data-backed decisions when they have to make decisions that can have important consequences. 

I look for ways to use my skills and knowledge to help people solve problems and make data-driven decisions.

If you're looking for someone who can help with your company's business strategy or offer advice on what your company should do next, contact me and let's work together.a
