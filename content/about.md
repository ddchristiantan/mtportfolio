Hey there! My name is Martin, and I'm a data scientist.

I love helping people make better decisions by teaching them how to harness the power of data and the scientific method. It's my goal to show people how to make good data-driven decisions when they have to make decisions that can have big consequences.

I like to automate routine tasks so that I can spend more time on activities that important to meâ€”like enjoying time with my family and studying. I'm also an avid fitness enthusiast who loves lifting weights, walking, and eating clean. I have fun linking it with data science because it allows me to combine my  passion in fitness and programming to track and assess my strength, performance and diet.

I enjoy learning new things and I try to find ways to simplify them and apply them to my work. I am interested in machine learning, data analysis, image analysis, and natural language processing.
