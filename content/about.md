Hi! I'm a data scientist and I love helping people make better, more informed decisions. I gained a lot of experience in an academic environment, but now I want to broaden my horizons and help people outside the lab.

I look for opportunities to use my skills and knowledge to help people solve problems and make data-driven decisions.

If you are looking for someone who can assist with your company's business strategy or provide advice on what your company should do next, contact me and let's work together.
